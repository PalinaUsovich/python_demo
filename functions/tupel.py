# tupel is something very similar to a list, you can store there different data types
# its an immutable (you can not change it
# we usually want to use tupel when we know we wont need to change the value of this variable
# the difference with lists is that in list you can change values or modify them , in tupel  - no!

coordinates = (3, 5)
print(coordinates[0])
# the list of tupels
# coordinates = [(3, 4), (87, 78),(23, 789)]
